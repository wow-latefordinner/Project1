HTTP & SQL project
Two models / Tables:
Product
Product Id (must be unique)
Product Name
Price
Seller Name
Seller
Seller Name (must be unique)
Naturally, the two tables must be related via a foreign key.
It is OK for the project to reset the database on every run of the API.
If you would like your project to persist between runs, you can just
comment out your .sql file's contents.
You may use the ConnectionSingleton, tables.sql, and pomfile provided
in the h2-template repo to start up the SQL integration.
On occassion, h2 files can get corrupted. If you suspect that this has happened, there is no harm in just deleting the 'h2' folder and allowing
h2 to regenerate its files.

Create/Read functionality on Seller
GET /seller/
- All sellers
POST /seller/
- Seller names must be non-null & unique
CRUD functionality on Product
GET /product/
- All products
GET /product/{id}
- Get a single product
- We should get a 404 error when we try to access a non-existed product.
POST /product/ - Add a single product
- Product ids should be non-null and unique
- Product names should be non-null
- Price should be over 0
- Seller name should refer to an actually existing seller
PUT /product/{id} - Update a single product
- Product names should be non-null
- Price should be over 0
- Seller name should refer to an actually existing seller
DELETE /product/{id} - Delete a single product
- DELETE should always return 200, regardless of if the item existed
at the start or not. This is convention.

Unit testing of service classes
- If you like, you can mock the DAO with mockito.
Otherwise, just resetting the DB between every test will be fine.
